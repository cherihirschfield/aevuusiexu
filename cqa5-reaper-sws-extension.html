Hi everyone, I'm kinda new to Reaper but I just became the "designated Reaper guy" at work. So I figured, I have to determine which extensions to install on our machines, create shortcut sets etc. Also people seem to not like the GUI so much, so I'm considering picking a "standard" GUI to use. From what I've gathered so far, I'll probably use SWS-Extension ( for improved usability and I'm looking into some themes, namely LCS versions for now (which, as I underst. REAPER Plug-in Extensions are additional components which can add functionality to REAPER.  The very popular SWS extension is an open source project, and contains many excellent examples of how to do useful things with the REAPER Extension. Specifically, one that will take one large WAV file, let me split it up into different songs, tag each one separately and then export in FLAC. I mix live shows for upload to archive.org and the most time consuming part is the tracking amp converting process (I use Cubase and it won't export to FLAC). Anyone have a handy program for this?

You can now, with the click of a couple of buttons, summon an automation clip with a basic waveform -- Saw L, Saw R, Triangle, Square, Sine, and then tweak it. Is there an extension or something for Reaper that allows this?

I'm new to Reaper and DAW based recording in general, which is how I got into this mess. https://imgur.com/a/VKzuy (Take mess.) I was recording on an acoustic drum set with two mics just to see what kind of result I would get. To do this, I was using the web control feature of Reaper from my phone - basically going to markers I had set up and recording multiple times. When I would screw up, because the loops were long, I would hit stop and then start the recording again. It broke these.

My band is currently using Reaper live for our clicks, backing tracks and MIDI switching, but I'm trying to find a way to make Reaper play one project, then switch to the next one without having to make my drummer stop what he's doing to click the next project. I've been experimenting with the SWS/SampM extensions with some luck, but I'd prefer to keep all the songs on different projects instead of having to combine them all into one and not be able to change our setlist easier.

Hey everyone, I've made the switch over to Reaper very recently, got to say i'm loving the customisation of everything so far. I'm using Reaper to make SFX, in my current workflow i'm using the time selection to create regions for the SFX variations with wildcards for automatic naming and numbering when rendering out. (Very cool time saving technique) I've been able to do pretty much everything i've wanted to so far with the SWS extensions but i can't seem to work out how to create a custom. I am really good at REAPER in its base form. I love it, I understand it, it works perfectly for me. However, I am looking at SWS extensions, and seeing it could possibly be even better.

I always loved to try different software, and in the end the DAW I like the most is Reaper and the one that I like least is ProTools.

I had a question, which turned out to be something Reaper doesn't do natively, so someone scripted a tool for me (and anyone else now) to be able to do that thing: Split Tool lets you copy split positions from media items on one track to another, and even multiple tracks. Great for drum editing multiple mic tracks or mults you might have forgotten to multi-select, or anything where you kind of later figured out you needed to copy edit positio.

Hey folks, I've been using Reaper for years to record, mix, and master music in addition to creating sound effects for a few video game projects. I'm looking to step up my skills and become a more valuable sound designer, and was hoping someone could offer some productivity tips.
