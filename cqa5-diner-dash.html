                            <p> My wife recently asked me to download diner dash 1 amp 2 to our PC but i can’t find it anywhere except for trials. I’m willing to buy them even. Current PC does not have a disc drive either. I can no longer find anyone selling this game :( I'd like to play the original series and not the new mobile version by Glu. Thanks. It was 2D, and the waitress you played as was a redhead. You go to the kitchen and ask the chef to cook a meal that corresponded to what the customer wanted. You had to seat the customers too. There was another version like it, except the animation was more rough and the waitress was blond instead. It had this soothing melody track in the background, CoryXKenshin uses this track sometimes during his videos. I can't put my tongue on what the game was called. It's a Diner Dash style game I remember playing on the PC in the early to mid 2000's. Unlike Diner Dahs you both make and serve the food and costomers both had to be seated and got take out orders at the counter. In the early levels your running a stall in a park or something like that and then you recive a bistro style restaurant (I think) from a your uncle or some other relative. I don't remember what the other restrants look like. I think the station where you make the food is on the bottom. So, I've been gaming for a long time and I'm just at that point where unless they are really good I'd rather play something that is fun but doesn't require complete attention while i do other stuff and still enjoy it. I was wondering what genre I should be looking under for this? similar to the sims or stellaris but nothing heavily turn based I enjoy active game play. Can anyone help me out? Need more games like this while I catch up on all of the netflix/movies/tv shows I've missed lately. Hey y'all, So it seems that Kitchen Rush falls into an interesting category. I hear it's like Overcooked the video game, but I haven't played that. In particular I was wondering if Kitchen Rush feels like a co-op version of a tycoon game: where you start as a small business, and then you gradual serve more customers to grow into a bigger business unlock more perks/a bigger restaurant, and really feel like you've built up a better, nicer, more accomplsihed restaurant. Sort of like Diner Open to rpgs or anything that is easy to get into if only for a few minutes. 
Platform(s): PC, I think the early ones were browser based, but there was definitely a downloadable version that saved your progress. Genre: Management type thing (I think), like Diner Dash but with a car lot that Estimated year of release: I'm not sure here, Late 2000's, early 2010's is the best guess I have. Graphics/art style: Sort of 2.5d I think, like side on, but also from above. Notable characters: I think you were given the lot from an uncle or something </p>
