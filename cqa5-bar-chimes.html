So, a week ago (or so), someone expressed not liking Medúlla and I made a ‘reconsideration post’ with details in each song that points out how special they all are. Here is Debut’s intricacies and best bits: Human Behaviour: a snare drum plays throughout this entire song, something I didn’t realise until I listened really hard. This song is incredibly rhythmic, naturally, much like The Sugarcubes. Later, Björk uses more beats and synthetic drum sounds. Don’t get me wrong, majority of the sounds. Here is a random thought: What if the first stanza of "Dango Daikazoku" was rearranged into grandfather clock chimes? Two bars would play for the first quarter (Dango, dango, dango, dango): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T8-8yqOjfI2c3HL30cs60Cr5rqgtlM-Q/view?usp=drivesdk Bars 5, 6, 7 and 8 would play for the half-hour chime (Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango daikazoku): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XIObuyRPrQUMo_m_PWfN3f3FSX4NYXZY/view?usp=drivesdk Bars 1 through 6 would Hi there, I’m a mod at r/TheGoodPlace. I’ve customized the search page for the sub (working on flair filters) and RES does not like it at all. Would appreciate some tips. What classes should I be targeting to get rid of that grey bar? Clicking hide search options does hide it, but it removes the search box as well. The constant sound of high-pitched metal tubes clanging together is straight up noise pollution! How could anyone find this soothing? At least lawn maintenance equipment and traffic noise actually make sense, but goddamn fucking metal pipes banging each other at even the slightest breeze is just sadistic. I don’t give a fuck if those eardrum torture devices are legal. Enforce the noise ordinances! (Shakes fist from porch if I had one) One or two wind chimes is fine if they’re not super noisy. Please keep your dick in your pants and out of your hand while I am walking by. I really don't care to watch you stroke yourself in public. Where can I find results for the elites that competed this weekend? There were 2-3 elite meets this weekend I can’t seem to find results for any of them. I’d like to see scores for Ashton, Jade, Sydney Morris 
Hey All! I was wondering if I could get a LC on this pair of Off-White Blazers. Most of it checks out, but the print on the zip tie and shoe laces gave me pause. Thanks in advance and apologies if any of the photos are poor. Most were taken quickly and in low light. Let me know if specific shots are needed and I can take them tonight. Off White Blazers from StockX (https://imgur.com/a/nrM48j9). It could happen for any number of reasons. The party wants to take a day off. They decide it’s better to leave in the morning. Someone gets completely sloshed and has to sleep it off. Whatever the reason, your left there sweating behind your DM screen because the party want to spend a fun evening in, and you need to provide an interesting location for them. So when that happens, here’s three taverns you can use in a pinch. \_\_\_ # Classy: As you make it to a street corner, a modest. Just curious how everyone feels about that mechanic. Also, how does everyone feel about the hunger bar shrinking as you age? I think it’s kind of cool, makes the old people stick around base so everyone knows they’ve. I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried just about everything. 
We have 3 boy piggies, we've had one for 2 years and the other two for a year and a half. They didn't get along too well at first, but they've been happy together for a long time. Last night out of no where they all started chittering at each other and trying to be the alpha male. It got to the point I had to separate them. AFAIK there hasn't been any fighting, and the oldest is being the instigator. Why are they doing this out of no where? Everything I find online isn't helpful because A few days ago I heard an album that was peaceful Christmas songs with no instruments except one, and it's one I can't identify. It sounded like "Christmas twinkles", I don't think they were bells. Maybe chimes? Xylophone? Not sure. It didn't sound like a toy, it sounded like a rich, peaceful, reverberating twinkle sound. .The album art was blue or something. I had it on spotify, and lost it :( If anyone wants to take a crack at it, give it a shot! amp#x200B; Vibrophone/Xylphone Hello all, recently I waa offered a bar manager position at a bar i jist started working at 3 weeks ago. The place is ran pretty loosely by the GM and AGM. The only thing that the employees don't get away with is drinking on the job but everything else its pretty much a freeforall. Half the employees know their shit and handle their business (whenever they show up on time that is) the other half hide away on their phones or restroom for over half their shift. There is a lot of downtime. A beer bear and a bare bear are hanging out at a bar. Beer bear is quite drunk, but he's not THAT far gone. He finally musters up the nerve to ask, "so bare bear, why on Earth are you naked? We're out in public and it's absolutely against all decorum and I fear you'll be arrested for public indecency!" "Oh beer bear, I know, I know, but you have to understand, I took a little e earlier and this simply feels AMAZING! You must try it." "But bare bear, where on earth did you get a little Link to song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8iGkTJtUQg).
